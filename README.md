cs_kMeansClustering
===================

C#/Windows Forms based example project showing K Means Clustering with 2D data.

K Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm which splits the training data
into k different clusters, each of them grouping similar examples.

kmc can be used to solve a wide range of problems; for example, [it has been used]
(http://people.csail.mit.edu/zp/moocshop2013/paper_16.pdf) to cluster
syntactically, thus semantically, similar solutions to a programming assignment in a MOOC
(massive online open course). Each cluster corresponded to a different approach to the problem
and they can help the teacher spotting common mistakes as well as creative solutions.
